      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz was born on August 13, 1926, in Birán, Cuba, into a wealthy family. He studied law at the University of Havana, where he became politically active. His early years were marked by a strong sense of social justice, which later influenced his revolutionary activities.</p>
      
      <h2>Education and Early Career</h2>
      <p>Castro became involved in student activism and later in politics, challenging the Cuban government of Fulgencio Batista. In 1953, after a failed attack on the Moncada Barracks, Castro was imprisoned, but his ideas gained popularity. After his release, he began organizing the Cuban Revolution with his brother Raúl Castro and others.</p>

      <h2>Revolution and Rise to Power</h2>
      <p>In 1959, Fidel Castro and his guerrilla army successfully overthrew the Batista regime, marking the beginning of Communist rule in Cuba. After the revolution, he became the Prime Minister and later the President of Cuba. Under his leadership, Cuba aligned with the Soviet Union and embarked on socialist reforms that reshaped Cuban society.</p>

      <h2>Leadership and Legacy</h2>
      <p>Castro’s leadership was marked by his commitment to socialism, the nationalization of industries, and the implementation of social programs. He led Cuba through a period of economic hardship, particularly following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, but he remained a symbol of resistance to U.S. imperialism. Despite international criticism for his authoritarian rule, he remained a prominent figure in global politics until his retirement in 2008.</p>

      <h2>Accomplishments</h2>

        <li>Overthrew the Batista dictatorship and established a socialist government in Cuba.</li>
        <li>Nationalized industry and implemented social programs in healthcare and education.</li>
