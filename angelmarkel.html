      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>Angela Dorothea Merkel was born on July 17, 1954, in Hamburg, West Germany, but was raised in East Germany after her family moved there when she was an infant. She grew up in a family of scientists, and her early life was marked by the constraints of East German society.</p>
      
      <h2>Education and Early Career</h2>
      <p>Merkel earned a doctorate in physics from the University of Leipzig in 1978. After completing her studies, she worked as a research scientist at the Central Institute for Physical Chemistry in East Berlin. She entered politics after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and quickly became a leading figure in Germany's reunification process.</p>

      <h2>Political Career</h2>
      <p>Merkel joined the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in 1989 and was elected to the Bundestag (German federal parliament) in 1990. She became the party leader in 2000 and was elected Chancellor of Germany in 2005, becoming the first woman to hold the office. Her leadership was defined by her pragmatism, strong economy policies, and support for the European Union.</p>

      <h2>Chancellorship</h2>
      <p>Merkel served as Chancellor of Germany from 2005 to 2021, overseeing Germany's recovery from the global financial crisis and guiding the European Union through crises such as the Greek debt crisis and the migrant crisis. She was widely praised for her steady leadership and commitment to the EU, but faced criticism for her handling of the refugee crisis in 2015.</p>

      <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>First female Chancellor of Germany.</li>
        <li>Played a central role in navigating Germany and Europe through the financial crisis and its aftermath.</li>
