      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin was born on October 7, 1952, in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), Russia. He grew up in a working-class family and developed an interest in martial arts and the KGB (Committee for State Security) during his youth.</p>
      
      <h2>Education and Early Career</h2>
      <p>Putin graduated from Leningrad State University in 1975 with a degree in law. He then joined the KGB, where he served as an intelligence officer for many years. His time in the KGB helped shape his political career and strategy in later years.</p>

      <h2>Political Career</h2>

After Boris Yeltsin’s resignation, Putin became acting president and was elected president in 2000. He has served multiple terms as president and prime minister of Russia.</p>

      <h2>Presidency</h2>
